## Hamburger Menu


The Hamburger Menu is a user interface element in web development designed for mobile viewing. It provides a compact and accessible way for users to navigate and access the main headers of a website. Typically represented by three horizontal lines, clicking or tapping on the hamburger icon reveals a dropdown or slide-in menu, optimizing the user experience on smaller screens by conserving space and prioritizing essential navigation elements.
